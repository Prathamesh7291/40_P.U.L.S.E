        Strengthening your heart is one of the best things you can do for your
        health. And as you know, the best way to strengthen your heart is to
        exercise In fact, if you don’t exercise you’re more than twice as likely
        to get heart disease as someone who does.

        <div class="quoteTxt"> If you have a history of heart disease, or just worry about your heart health, you need to develop a regular exercise routine. Experts recommended you spend at least 150 minutes doing moderate exercise per week.

                    Aerobic exercise improves circulation, which results in lowered blood pressure and heart rate, Stewart says. In addition, it increases your overall aerobic fitness, as measured by a treadmill test, for example, and it helps your cardiac output (how well your heart pumps).

                <div class="def">
                    Resistance training has a more specific effect on body composition, Stewart says. For people who are carrying a lot of body fat (including a big belly, which is a risk factor for heart disease), it can help reduce fat and create leaner muscle mass. Research shows that a combination of aerobic exercise and resistance work may help raise HDL (good) cholesterol and lower LDL (bad) cholesterol.

                    Flexibility workouts, such as stretching, don’t directly contribute to heart health. What they do is benefit musculoskeletal health, which enables you to stay flexible and free from joint pain, cramping and other muscular issues. That flexibility is a critical part of being able to maintain aerobic exercise and resistance training, says Stewart.
